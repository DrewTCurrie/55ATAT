 #09/19/2024 Update: 
 #Automatic Report generation script. This script will be used to create a report every week on Friday at 5:00PM and the last day of every month at 5:00PM
 # In addition to generating the report at the end of the month, the script will move all data from the currentAttendanceEvents database table to 
 # the ArchiveAttendanceEvents database table, and then when verified the data has been transferred, it will empty the currentAttendanceEvents 
 # database table to prepare for the next month of attendance events.


#Libraries used:
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, date
import calendar
import sys, time
from reports import generateReport
#Add to system path the directory of the API Functions to access the utilities functions
sys.path.insert(0, '/home/drew/Documents/capstone/55ATAT/APIFuncs')
from APIFuncs import utils

    #If today is equal to the last day of the month create a report
